# DotKernel 3 Workshops

## [See workshop list](workshop-list.md)

## What is a workshop?

A workshop is a guided tutorial where the code is mostly written by the reader (developer, student, etc).

DotKernel 3 workshop repositories will have the following naming format: `dotkernel/ws-*`
Eg.: `dotkernel/ws-dependency-injection`

## What is the workshop structure

* Introduction
    * Summary of workshop
    * Prerequisites (required knowledge)
    * Expected result
    * Planning
* Steps (as many as required, with input and expected output examples)
* Tests (PHP files that check if the code was executed as expected)
 

## Did I do the right thing?

If the expected input and output are the same as ours means it worked.
You can always check if your code or logic matches with the one written by us.

Every workshop repository comes with a number of branches to reflect each step.

Therefore:
* `introduction` stands for Workshop Introduction, including expected example (in an abstract way)
  *  if needed the Introduction section can be splitted, branches examples: `introduction-1`, `introduction-2`
* `step-x` stands for each step and should not be splitted, but there can be exceptions in which case the step will be spllited as `step-x-letter`, eg: `step-1-a`, `step-1-b` 

>  Note: knowing what to do is more important than just getting the job done â€“ *gabidj*

## What if my version is better?

If you think your version works better than ours please submit an ***Issue*** or a ***Pull Request*** and let us know which is your approach.
We would love to check it out.
